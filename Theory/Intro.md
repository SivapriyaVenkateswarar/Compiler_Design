A **terminal symbol** is a basic symbol in a language that **cannot be broken down further** during parsing. It is one of the fundamental components of a grammar used in compiler design.

### Key Points:
- Terminal symbols are the **actual symbols** that appear in the source code.
- Examples include:
  - Keywords: `if`, `while`, `return`
  - Operators: `+`, `*`, `=`
  - Identifiers and literals: `x`, `42`, `"hello"`
  - Punctuation: `;`, `(`, `)`
- Terminals are **generated by the lexical analyzer** as tokens.
- They are **used by the parser** to build the syntax tree.
